# Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis

**Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis** is a comprehensive data analysis tool designed to streamline data exploration, analysis, and visualisation. The tool supports multiple data formats and provides an intuitive interface for both novice and expert data scientists.

The purpose of this project is to analyse healthcare insurance data to understand how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance costs and develop predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses. Provide insights and predictive reports for estimating healthcare insurance charges based on personal and geographic attributes.

## Dataset Content

The dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits) and geographic factors and their impact on medical insurance charges. This data can be used to study how these features influence insurance costs and develop predictive reports for estimating healthcare expenses.

## Business Requirements

-   I am looking to use this dataset to be able to predict the cost of insurance based on different characteristics and circumstances.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

-   Hypothesis 1:
-   Hypothesis 2:
-   Hypothesis 3:
    and how you envision validating it (them)

## Project Plan

-   Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
-   How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
-   Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

-   List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used

-   List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
-   How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
-   Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
-   How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations

-   Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
-   How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Unfixed Bugs

-   Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
-   Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
-   If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap

-   What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
-   What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience?

## Main Data Analysis Libraries

-   matplotlib library and documentation on the boxplots https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html
